Which are very needed for keeping the gameplay exciting and enjoyable.</p>\n<p>\n        <div class=\"embedVideo-container\">\n            <iframe\n              title=\"\"\n              width=\"800\"\n              height=\"400\"\n              src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RxlY17MRfsg?rel=0\"\n              class=\"embedVideo-iframe\"\n              style=\"border:0\"\n              \n              \n              loading=\"lazy\"\n              allowfullscreen\n\t      sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"\n            ></iframe>\n        </div></p>\n<h2>New ability: Link with turret</h2>\n<p>The player can now link with turrets and take control of them. This also boosts the turret to level 3, so the player has an additional way to get level 3 (red) weapons in use. After walls are added to the build system, this ability is more efficient.</p>\n<center> <img src=\"/17b0c6bf5b0da1a30643eb84296f3aeb/linking_with_turret.gif\" alt=\"LinkingWithTurret\" style=\"width:80%;height:auto;margin:auto\"></center>\n<h2>Enemies got some new features too!</h2>\n<p>Red robot now has a \"big brother,\" which will spawn mines when they are attacking the player. In numbers these might cause a problem.</p>\n<center> <img src=\"/fb3a0a087c34b4e75518c0ce86c8baf5/mines_spawning.gif\" alt=\"Mines\" style=\"width:80%;height:auto;margin:auto\"></center>\n<p>Blue robot has a special ability to block bullets and shock the player. Shock ability is not yet fully functional, but it is building up nicely.</p>\n<center> <img src=\"/e51eed0819497f8abe5e496cff7c617f/blue_enemy_shield.gif\" alt=\"BlueEnemyShield\" style=\"width:80%;height:auto;margin:auto\"></center>\n<h2>Social media</h2>\n<p>I once said that I'm not a social media expert, and I somewhat don't even like to post things on social media platforms.\r\nBut I have posted some development content on X and Reddit and got some good feedback there too. And yes, it still feels a bit overwhelming.\r\nI do not know how someone has so much time to post tweets or videos; I struggle even with simple GIFs.</p>\n<p>I know it is kind of necessary to do self-marketing on social media platforms for indie developers to get any attention, but still, I'm not a big fan of it.\r\nA couple of times, I have even managed to get zero response from Reddit. I do not know how it is possible, but yes, I have done it. Or... this is a very common case on Reddit(?).</p>\n<p>If you want to check my posts, you can find the links to my accounts from this page footer!</p>\n<h2>What's next, a playable demo?</h2>\n<p>I have plans to get a playable demo out somewhere (probably on Itch.io) and gather more feedback with it. I do not know when this is going to happen, but I'll inform you when it is available.</p>\n<p>Now the main focus is to get a playable alpha for anyone who wants to try it and get more feedback from it.</p>\n<p>Let's get this happening!
