That theme change has cost me a lot of time, but I think it was worth it, and it gives lots of opportunities to expand the game.</p>\n<p>Overall, all has been going somewhat well. I have managed to get lots of under-the-hood features to work, like gamepad support and a functional save/load system. Also, from a programming perspective, it is very easy to add new power-ups and weapons at the code level. So it should be an easy task to add new weapons or power-upsÂ to the game.</p>\n<p>But as always, time is of the essence.</p>\n<h2>Not everything went as I thought</h2>\n<p>Many things didn't go so well either. I had a very optimistic plan to get a playable demo out at the end of the spring. Just a couple months after I started doing this project regularly. Well, obviously that didn't happen. Then I changed the demo release day in my calendar to the middle of summer and then to the end of summer. Both cases failed.</p>\n<p>So what went wrong? Too optimistic estimation of how long some features could take and some refactor situations give me setbacks. Right now, 80% of those things I have planned for the demo are done, but I think the game is not ready for public testing, and the main reason is in the gameplay. I have not balanced anything yet in the game; it has not even started. Also, the gameplay itself is a bit boring right now. More different weapons, enemies, and a few new power-ups could be a huge upgrade.</p>\n<p>The problem is, when I add a new weapon, enemy, or whatever, I have to draw lots of new icons, animations, etc., and that takes time. Not so long as it used to take, but some time still.\r\nCan I cut corners? Maybe, and probably I should, but where is the golden line here?</p>\n<h2>Trailer</h2>\n<p>Now to the new trailer, showcase... video, which shows the current progress. Enjoy!</p>\n<p>\n        <div class=\"embedVideo-container\">\n            <iframe\n              title=\"\"\n              width=\"800\"\n              height=\"400\"\n              src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JKuPekEaqXE?rel=0\"\n              class=\"embedVideo-iframe\"\n              style=\"border:0\"\n              \n              \n              loading=\"lazy\"\n              allowfullscreen\n\t      sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"\n            ></iframe>\n        </div></p>\n<h2>Future plans: how to go onward?</h2>\n<p>Still, I have a real intention to get this game into the publish stage. When will it happen? I can't say, obviously, I'm not very good at time estimations. In my mind I have a month and the year, but let's see how close I can get.</p>\n<p>In the more technical sense, I have plans to start balancing the systems. Enemies, weapons, the whole set. Then, it is probably easier to add new features when I can see what needs to be added to keep things in balance.</p>\n<p>That is all for now, thanks!</p>\n<p><em>-Teemu, TheAspen</em></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"05.09.2024","title":"Status check"}}},"pageContext":{"index":10}},"staticQueryHashes":["3359217925","3930925630"],"slicesMap":{}}
