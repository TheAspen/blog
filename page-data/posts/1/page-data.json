I'm not a regular blog poster or any kind of social media expert.\nI even found writing this very first blog post a bit uneasy (at least). So, if you find these posts a bit\n\"unprofessional\" or somewhat clumsy. You know the reason now (and you have also been warned!).</p>\n<p>Well, someone might ask, \"Why did you start writing a blog then?\". The answer to that is somewhat simple.\nFirst, I wanted a place to share the progress of my game. Overall, at some point, if I manage to get this project into the publishing phase, I have to start sharing information for advertising purposes. I actually asked AI (Chat GPT).\n\"What is a good marketing plan for your game\"? Or something like that, and one of the answers was \"Start a game development blog.\"\nSo here it is! And I would also say that covers the second reason, which is advertising my game for the future by showing how it was made.\nI'm a programmer by trade, not a social media influencer, but because now I'm \"a one-man indie game studio,\" I have to start doing this advertising or \"marketing\" thing too.</p>\n<p>However, one thing is concerning my mind: what if this blog starts taking time from the actual development work? And it actually has done that already, so even before I manage to start this blog posting thing, I'm a bit worried for the project. But let's see how this goes.\nSo if there is some time between the posts, don't worry; I probably only focus more on the development work, and I might post one bigger blog post later on.\nHowever, I'll try to post at least one blog post per month. At least for now.</p>\n<p>The second post will cover the project much more. This first one is just for \"getting used to\" this blog writing and getting the first post out.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the future posts and stay tuned!</p>\n<p>Welcome, and thanks for joining this journey with me.</p>\n<p><em>-Teemu, TheAspen</em></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"09.02.2024","title":"The first post"}}},"pageContext":{"index":1}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
