It was dated March 27, 2021, so the project is almost three years old. However, this was not my only project during these couple of years. There was one tabletop/D&#x26;D dice roller application and one horror game prototype, but I might write more about those later on.</p>\n<p>I started this project because I felt there was not a simple, casual top-down shooter that you could play when you feel a bit bored and you do not want to play too complex games that need more concentration. I wanted a wave survival shooter game in which you could build walls and turrets for your defenses and also upgrade your own weaponry. A very simple concept after all.</p>\n<p>But as I said, I had other projects, so this project was on hold for over a year, and again during the autumn of 2023, I decided to start working on this project again.</p>\n<h2>So what is the plan?</h2>\n<p>The plan today is to create a top-down shooter where enemies come in waves, the player can upgrade weapons, buy new ones, or find them from the eliminated enemies, pixel-art graphics, and the game will take place in space. I have concepted a story mode too, but from the first version, I had to cut that out.</p>\n<h2>The project so far</h2>\n<p>I have been focusing on core functionalities like player movement, shooting, and item pickup to get up and running smoothly. Also, basic things like saving and loading have taken much more time than I thought. Graphics are still in very simple form; expect a minimap. For now, enemies are presented with different colors, and all of them have different abilities, like orange has more HP than yellow, but yellow is faster. Probably that kind of system will be in the final version too, but of course in a more complex graphical shape.\r\nMinimap is probably the only thing that is very close to its final form.</p>\n<p>Some screenshots below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/screenshot1.png\" alt=\"Some screenshots 1\" title=\"pre-alpha screenshot 1\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/screenshot3.png\" alt=\"Some screenshots 2\" title=\"pre-alpha screenshot 3\"></p>\n<h2>Final words</h2>\n<p>This was a very brief walk-through of the project, its current status, and what the big plan is. I hope this gives some information about what I'm doing here.</p>\n<p>Enjoy the post; see you next time!</p>\n<p><em>-Teemu, TheAspen</em></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"13.02.2024","title":"Project's introduction"}}},"pageContext":{"index":2}},"staticQueryHashes":["3359217925","3930925630"],"slicesMap":{}}
