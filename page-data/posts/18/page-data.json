I think the Beta version of Enfora Star has started nicely.</p>\n<p>Most of the time I have been working on new enemies for the game. So let's see which kind of droids can be found in the enemy ranks today!</p>\n<p>I have already mentioned that the orange and pink droids got their advanced counterparts, but maybe I could go into some details about them.</p>\n<p>Orange v2.0:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shoots missiles randomly around itself</li>\n<li>Marks the missile landing area first, and after a few seconds launches the missile.</li>\n<li>Very powerful and medium-sized blast zone.</li>\n<li>Slow, but very tanky.</li>\n</ul>\n<center> <img src=\"/45893fb23ee1c166e3c849e97491fc0e/enfora-star-orangev2-shooting-wm.gif\" alt=\"Orange droid v2\" style=\"width:100%;height:auto;margin:auto\"></center>\n<p>Pink v2.0:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spawns pink v1.0 droids when nearby.</li>\n<li>Spawn rate will increase over time.</li>\n<li>Very dangerous in numbers.</li>\n</ul>\n<center> <img src=\"/f2bd8d0ae3368a6a8a9121c29ec4370c/enfora-star-pinkv2-spawning-wm.gif\" alt=\"Pink droid v2 \" style=\"width:100%;height:auto;margin:auto\"></center>\n<p>Yellow v2.0:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Uses dash when the player is nearby</li>\n<li>Huge collision damage and kickback if hit with the dash.</li>\n<li>Fastest enemy in the game.</li>\n</ul>\n<center> <img src=\"/57db7379b8eb80211ff5a946ff518328/enfora-star-yellowv2-dash-mw.gif\" alt=\"Yellow droid v2 \" style=\"width:100%;height:auto;margin:auto\"></center>\n<h2>Steam SDK</h2>\n<p>I would really like to get Steam achievements included in the game, and in my mind, they are a must these days.</p>\n<p>But, I have never worked with Steam SDK before, and it was kind of a \"black box\" for me at the start.</p>\n<p>So where to start? Luckily there is a web page called <a href=\"https://godotsteam.com/\">https://godotsteam.com/</a>, which was also mentioned in the official Steam pages, that can help me with this implementation.</p>\n<p>There are guides on how to build your own editor with Steam SDK, but also links to the pre-made builds, which can communicate right away with the Steam API.</p>\n<p>I decided to build my own editor version from source, and now I should be able to use the Steam API through that.\r\nI haven't tested if it is fully functional, but at least it built and started just fine.</p>\n<h2>Work, work, and more work</h2>\n<p>Today I have to update Steam with Development updates from time to time, so there is just one new platform to keep updated too. :)</p>\n<p>I also have tried to keep up on the social media platforms (X and Bluesky), so let's see if this blog just turns into another \"Steam Development Update.\" But I'm trying to keep things here on a more personal level and on a more professional level in the Steam posts.</p>\n<p>The next big thing is to test the custom Godot editor with Steam SDK and see if it is really working as expected. When I get this to work, I can focus more on the achievements. And maybe even add the highscore system into Steam?</p>\n<p>That's all for this time. See ya next month!</p>\n<p><em>Teemu, TheAspen</em></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"11.05.2025","title":"Towards the Beta!"}}},"pageContext":{"index":18}},"staticQueryHashes":["3359217925","3930925630"],"slicesMap":{}}
