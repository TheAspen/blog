You should be able to produce sounds because a mute game will also\nbe boring very soon. Maybe you should be able to make music too. Then there is the more technical side: programming; without it, you would not be able to even try. Maybe you also should know how to design a game; otherwise, you will\nfall into the very common pitfalls. Also, UI design is not a bad skill either, because if the UI is bad, it will ruin the whole experience, right?\nSo... a few skills to master?</p>\n<p>The reason why I started with this observation is that I have been working on all of these fields in the past month, and it has been a bit overwhelming. Drawing, making sounds (even some music), bugfixing, and creating new features\nand designing them, creating more bugs, refactoring some existing code, or re-designing a feature. Nothing really new, but when you do lots of different things and encounter new problems in somewhat new areas, it feels a bit stressful.\nStill, I'd like to make everything by myself and not buy them. I'm not sure if this is already a doomed task, but time will tell.</p>\n<p>I also think I should start taking small notes while I'm working; it would be easier to write this development blog with the memo notes. But in a nutshell, most of the time has gone for power-up systems and sound effects/music.</p>\n<h2>Pre-Alpha Trailer</h2>\n<p>I created this short demo to show the current status. You might see some default symbols and images here and there, but let's not let that bother us. Enjoy the demo:</p>\n<p>\n        <div class=\"embedVideo-container\">\n            <iframe\n              title=\"\"\n              width=\"800\"\n              height=\"400\"\n              src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9pyabRQvlNU?rel=0\"\n              class=\"embedVideo-iframe\"\n              style=\"border:0\"\n              \n              \n              loading=\"lazy\"\n              allowfullscreen\n\t      sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"\n            ></iframe>\n        </div></p>\n<h2>End thoughts</h2>\n<p>Some thoughts for the end. Gameplay is the main thing in the games, in my opinion; if it is not polished enough, the game is not working and it is not fun to play. For now, it seems that this project has that problem.\nMaybe I have played the same scene over and over again, so I am just bored with it, but it feels like something is missing. Anyhow, I'm planning to finish and polish the current work-in-progress features and such, and then\nI have to design to make the current core gameplay a bit more enjoyable. Easier to say than done, but such is life.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading!</p>\n<p><em>-Teemu, TheAspen</em></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"19.05.2024","title":"Pre-Footage Trailer"}}},"pageContext":{"index":6}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
