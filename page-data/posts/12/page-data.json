(aka. drawing).</p>\n<p>I have some regrets about taking the game to the space environment; I should have kept up with simple geometric shapes. Is it too late to go back?</p>\n<p>I do like drawing, and I think I have found my own \"style\" with it, but this takes a huge amount of my time in the development process.</p>\n<p>This is a solo game development project, so I hire someone to do, let's say, pixel art for me. Is it anymore a solo project?</p>\n<p>Let's check some of the new stuff, however!</p>\n<p>Here is the player's base as a whole. I'm not 100% satisfied with the outcome, and it looks a bit too repeatable. But here is the version 1.0, at least.</p>\n<center> <img src=\"/11f4b8353a95211b440ce04bb9858786/Base_proto1.gif\" alt=\"Base\" style=\"width:90%;height:auto;margin:auto\"></center>\n<p>Here is the new gun. I was trying to get a bit of an old, cannon-like look here.</p>\n<center> <img src=\"/b5e1eb557a46a50de950feb3e0d09ad1/new_guns.gif\" alt=\"NewGuns\" style=\"width:50%;height:auto;margin:auto\"></center>\n<p>Some new particle effects are taking place too; here is the player's healing effect.</p>\n<center> <img src=\"/e60a55415fc3f6b8775018fea0e5fa7c/heal_particle_proto1.gif\" alt=\"HealingParticle\" style=\"width:50%;height:auto;margin:auto\"></center>\n<h2>Enemies targeting system</h2>\n<p>Enemies got an update to their targeting system. Now they focus the base as prior one target. The player can still lure enemies with a decoy power-up or flying close to them. Some enemies, however, might find this a bit anoying.</p>\n<center> <img src=\"/c83728fa0c6450552e981e666bc92bac/dont_get_too_close2.gif\" alt=\"EnemyAggro\" style=\"width:90%;height:auto;margin:auto\"></center>\n<p>So I created an aggro system for some enemies. It will be triggered if the player stays too close to the enemy. After aggro is activated, the enemy gets a speed boost and will follow the player until the end of times.</p>\n<h2>That's all for now</h2>\n<p>And by the way, I do add updates on a somewhat irregular basis into <a href=\"https://x.com/TheAspenDev\">X</a> too.\r\nSo if you are interested in hearing about the project more often than once a month, please visit on the X-platform! (You can find the link in this page footer too!).</p>\n<p>I'll keep up the work, see ya next time!</p>\n<p><em>Teemu, TheAspen</em></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"11.11.2024","title":"Working with visuals"}}},"pageContext":{"index":12}},"staticQueryHashes":["3359217925","3930925630"],"slicesMap":{}}
