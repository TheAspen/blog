# <center>Concept changes</center>

##

For some time the whole concept of the game has been a bit lost or at least somewhat hard to discribe. First, it was a wave by wave survival game with power ups and different weapons. Well, nothing hard to understand there, but the whole game felt a bit boring. Huge waves of enemies were fun for a short time, but in the long run, it started a feel a bit boring.

I have a story mode in my mind, where player could adventure around the space. Story mode could give a many oppotunities for designing different type of scenarios for the game, but that might be too much of work.

So, I have designed this new concept around the wave mode, but adding some twists into it.

The ground work for the coneption change is ongoing and probably will be ready in this month.

## Concept arts

Here is the very first version of the base, or at least part of it.

I also drawn a concept for the updating center. So the player spaceship will be docked on the bay here and player can browse the updates for weapons or new power ups. This is one is fully a background art, and will not be part of the gameplay.

## Godot and its community

I'm not going to take a huge statement of the recent events in the Godot community, but I understand people whom are full of the Godot and its officials right now. I do not follow so much what is happening in the social media platforms and I actually heard first this from friend of mine.
So, this kind of madness does not affect my work or actions that much, and I'm just doing games with the Godot and for now that is the way I'll go on. I'll going to follow the Redot project with very intrest and I wish them good luck. (btw, their logo looks a way cooler than Godot's original!)

I already thanked the community forums for the voting this project to the featured-projects showcase in the X. But I'd like to thank them again here too! That really made my day when I regonize this whole thing and really give me a boost for working on the project.
So, thank you!

## It's almost the Halloween

I think thats all for now, I'm maybe a bit early, but happy Halloween to everyone!
