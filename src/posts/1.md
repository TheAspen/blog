# The first post with some thoughts

First, a little notification. I'm not a regular blog poster or any kind of social media expert.
I even found this very fist blog post writing.. a bit uneasy at least. So, if you find these posts a bit
"unprofessional" or somewhat clumsy.. you know the reason now (and you also have warned!).

Well, someone might ask "Why you started to writing a blog then?". The answer for that is somewhat simple.
First, I wanted to place to share the progress of my game. Overall, at somepoint, if I manage to get this project
to the publishing stage I have to start sharing information for advertising in mind. So I asked from Chat GPT
(No, I'm not sponsored by Chat GPT.) "What is a good way to marketing your game"? Or something like that, and
one of the answers were "Start a game development blog". So here it is and I would say that also covers the second reason which is
the advertising my game for the future by showing how it was made. I'm a programmer by my trade, not a social media influencer, but
because now I'm "a one man indie game studio" I have to start doing this thing too.

One of my main fear is that this blog starts taking time from the actual development work, and it probably will at least sometimes,
but I'll try to find out the balance between these too. The game is the main thing, and this is just a side-effect from that. 
So there might be some time between the posts, but I'll try to at least one post per month. At least for now.

The second posts will cover the project a bit more. This first one is just for "getting use to" this blog writing and get the first post out.

I hope you enjoy the future posts and stay tune!

Welcome and thanks for joining!
