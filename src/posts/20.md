## The Alpha has come to an end

The Alpha game test has now come to an end. So from now on, it is not available on Steam anymore. I guess it will remain in your library if you got it, but it is not playable.
But if you can still play it, feel free to do so!

I got some feedback and suggestions, and many of them are already implemented in the game, but I was hoping to get a little more feedback overall.
The Google Forms way to gather it was somewhat of a failure. You really need to set up a Discord or a very simple platform where testers can give feedback easily and anonymously.
Then I think you'll get more feedback in general. I probably will try Discord next time, maybe even with the Beta version?

I also recommend to use Steam's game test pages, because they were a very good and simple way to share the playable demo. Putting them in "hidden" mode was only a few clicks in the control panel. Very easy!

Thank you to all who joined the Alpha gametest and provided feedback! You have helped me a lot in developing Enfora Star in the right direction!

## Gameplay updates

Now droids might attack from multiple directions in one wave, so you have to build defenses all around the space station. The minimap will show the upcoming wave directions before the wave starts. So you can prepare your defenses effectively.

Also, you can now upgrade the turrets to the 2nd level (blue color). But you have two more turrets available: Space Cannon and Wave Gun. These updates add more strategy to the gameplay and support multiple different play styles.

You can also repair walls and the station during the build phase. So if your defenses fail, it is not that punitive.

## New pickable items: Weapon and Armor updates

At first, it was just a test to see how it would work if you could update your damage output with pickable updates. But I noticed soon that I was really hunting those update drops and comparing weapons to each other to see which I should use. So this feature really added a layer of interest, and I already had a pickup icon for it, which I had made some time ago.

So how does it work?

You pick up the weapon update, and it randomly adds damage to one already owned weapon. So if you want to boost just one weapon, you should not buy or collect new weapons, because then the chance to get the damage boost to that weapon is lower. And this update is permanent for the current run.

Weapon update icons:

Adding armor pickups was the logical next step, so now players can update armor to prevent damage. These pickable variants also reduced the amount of shop item drops, which are not wanted anymore after you have collected all weapons and power-ups from the store.

## The station's visual updates

The space station visuals will now update by the damage it has taken. Nothing game-changing here, but it adds more depth to the visual aspect.

## The end boss thing

I have also put lots of time into the end boss, and by far it is the most complex enemy in the game right now. I actually do not want to spoil this too much, but let's say it might use similar things against you like you use against enemies.

Let's keep the "thing" in the shadows for now..

## Future plans

For future plans, I have an idea to get Beta to the next Steam Next Fest, and I hope you'll join the Beta testing when it is available!

The next thing is to update UI components and finalize the main menu. So for the next couple of weeks, I'll be working with buttons and such. It might not sound like the most interesting stuff, but I actually like it.

That's all for now, until next time!
