## You don't have to fight alone!

Now, a bigger new feature in a while: Allies!

You can now buy allies to fight on your side, and they will also follow you along the map. Right now they only follow you, but I have planned to add some simple commands like "stay here" and "follow me."

They are not the brightest ones either, but can really make a difference in the early levels and are fun to watch flying around. You can also repair them in the build phase, so remember to do so if you have plans to use them. As always, there are three different level variants for them: green is the lowest, blue is the mid-tier, and red is the most advanced one.

## HUD Updates

HUD/UI updates are now taking place, and the final layout is here! Some final touches in a few places and it is done.

Here is the comparison to the old one:

New:

The main menu now has a video rolling in the background. This is not the final version, but you get the idea.

## The beta demo is coming!

The beta demo is coming up nicely, but there is still a long list of bugs and issues to be fixed. So I'll continue with that and keep this post a bit short.
At the next Steam Next Fest, you should be able to play the beta demo, and I have to cut some other activities (like this blog) to get things ready.

So next month, there will be no blog post. (Very likely, unless something miraculous happens and all the bugs will just be fixed by themselves.)
And the planned release is still for this year, so soon it is time to wrap up everything.

Stay tuned though! This has been a long road so far, and the finish line is on the horizon!

Thanks again for joining me on this journey!

See ya in October!
