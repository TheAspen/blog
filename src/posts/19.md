## Steam Achievements and leaderboard

Last time I mentioned Steam SDK and that I was starting to work with it. After all, everything went very smoothly. The achievement system was very easy to setup thanks to guides from https://godotsteam.com/ and documentations from Steam. Both websites provide everything you need to get achievement system up and running, and I have to admit, it was pretty sweet feeling to see achievement pop-up coming up first time during the testing.

First, the achievements were the only thing I have plans to be implemented, but leaderboard and highscores can be implemented to Steam too. So I decided to do a little investigations and see how hard it could be to implement the whole scoreboard to the Steam and therefore get some sort of competition element to the game.

Well, the short answer is: easy and not so easy.

The scores were somewhat easy going, but the user names where the tricky part. Apperentely you can get Steam account's user names from your friends list or from the game lobby just like that, but if users are not into your friends list and in this case there is no lobby. It will come a bit difficulty.
I think there is a way to search them by SteamId, but that could take relative long time, so I'm not sure is that going to work. And however, I did not get any working solutions for this, so I do not know is that fast or not.

What I manage to get work is a system that player could write a custom name for the leaderboard scores, but I have some fears of the names I could see on the board.
Some validations for the names might work, but in the end someone will bypass it with some peculiar character combination.
So for now, Steam leaderboard is not included. The implementation is still remain under the hood, so I could check this again in the future.

## Special waves and special droids

More droids are also join in the ranks! So lets introduce them right a way:

Blue v2.0:

- Shoots EMP projectiles which moves randomly
- Also has "shockwave" which protects from bullets and slows down the player if he/she hits to it. The blue v1.0 has this very same ability.

Special enemy: Banshee

- Can use invisibility for sometime
- Shoot beam projectiles in short range
- Shoots "system shock" or "system stun" projectiles which causes player utilities go off. Means power-ups, dash and minimap is out of use for a while.

Right now the Banshee serve as a miniboss, so I would not like to spoil it too much. But here is the look at least.

## Some end thoughts once again

New enemy variants are now in place, and the end boss is also coming up nicely. Yes, there will be the boss battle at the end.
But still I feel a bit worried about the schedule I have give to myself. I will finish this up in this year, but is the end result the one I was looking for?

Also it feels a bit frustrating to create "marketing" material to social media all the time, and only for couple of views? Well, this is not a good thing, but I have heard that other indie developers struggle this very same thing. At least for the views part.
Or maybe the game is just not the coolest looking?

I also want to mention that I send the Enfora Star to [GDWC](https://thegdwc.com/) So wish me luck! I don't have much expectations, but I have thoughts to participate to the competition from 2017 and almost a decade later I finally get there!

And check the Haapa Games [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@HaapaGames)
Subsrcibe it too, don't make my frustration go to waste! ;)

I guess thats it for now, enjoy the Summer!
