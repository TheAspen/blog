## Should I hire a visual artist?

Most of the time of the last month I have been working with Aseprite and pixel placement. (aka. drawing).

I have some regrets about taking the game to the space environment; I should have kept up with simple geometric shapes. Is it too late to go back?

I do like drawing, and I think I have found my own "style" with it, but this takes a huge amount of my time in the development process.

This is a solo game development project, so I hire someone to do, let's say, pixel art for me. Is it anymore a solo project?

Let's check some of the new stuff, however!

Here is the player's base as a whole. I'm not 100% satisfied with the outcome, and it looks a bit too repeatable. But here is the version 1.0, at least.

Here is a new gun also. I was looking a bit old, cannon-like look here.

Some new particle effects are taking place too; here is the player's healing effect.

## Enemies targeting system

Enemies got an update to their targeting system. Now they focus the base as prior one target. The player can still lure enemies with a decoy power-up or flying close to them. Some enemies, however, might find this a bit anoying.

So I created an aggro system for some enemies. It will be triggered if the player stays too close to the enemy. After aggro is activated, the enemy gets a speed boost and will follow the player until the end of times.

## That's all for now

And by the way, I do add updates on a somewhat irregular basis into [X](https://x.com/TheAspenDev) too.
So if you are interested in hearing about the project more often than once a month, please visit on the X-platform! (You can find the link in this page footer too!).

I'll keep up the work, see ya next time!
