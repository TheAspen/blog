## Happy Birthday devlog!

At the start this was a somesort of test, mainly for myself. Let's see can I do regular blog posting for a while, and I was also curious how this would affect to my project.
I was worried could this blog come an obstacle of sort, and slower my game development. Well, in a way it did.

Sometimes I find writing this a bit tricky, and this usally take me a few days to write a single post. I think I should do this faster, like in few hours. But yes, these usually take few days at worst.

Why this is the case? Hard to say. Maybe I tried too much to give you any interesting content, and because of that, I think too much.
Maybe I should try to be more casual on this year? :)

But also, this blog has give a fixed place for people to check updates of this project. Due I do not have a Steam page.( Yet, more about this later. )
I did not have social media accounts ges back then, but I decided to give Reddit and X a chance.
So today, you can get smaller updates at least on X too. Reddit I do not use so often.

But does anybody read this very blog post, I do not know. But, if you do, I want to Thank you!

Between daily job and house holding, this has not always been easy to develop game and maintain a blog about it.

## One year of progress

So, what has been happened so far?

In the last year, all enemies were still a geometric shapes, all weapons shoot the very same bullets, weapons have no levels and the background was a simple blue plane.
And these were only few things mentioned of the project back then.

I tried to make the best visualization of the progress and I think I made a pretty good job:

## BFG and many more updates!

Let's first drive into details what I have done during the last month. Because January was a good month in progress:

- Spawn mechanism is updated so wave enemies are randomized. No fixed enemies anymore.

- More particle effects:

  - Player destruction effects.
  - Pickable objects destruction and picking up effects.

- Base destruction effects and explosions.

- One of the weapons (BFG) got new sprites and icons.

- Sounds added for weapons and effects. Not ready though.

- More settings, like background grid can be disabled or enabled.

- Gamepad focus is now more clear.

- Highscore save and load system.

- Some clean ups and bugfixes.

Here is some GIF's for visualization:

</center>

The Alpha seems to come up nicely, but Steam pages will take a extra month after all. When I sign up for Steam's partnership they will look into my accounts and its details. This will usually take a month, so there is not much I can do about it.
So if you wish to wishlist (yes, intended.) OR even better, want to try playtest, you'll have to wait a another month at least.

Next I'll have another month planned, and pretty much same amount of tasks to do. I hope I'll keep this momentum.

# Tip for the end

Nothing more this time, but one "tip" for playing this game. Do not trap yourself behind the walls, because yes, you can do that:
