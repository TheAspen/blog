These couple of weeks have been very "artistic" loaded at least. Lots of prototyping, concepting, animating and the most of, learning how to use Asprite for
these purposes. Pixel art style is the way I decided to go, and Asprite is the tool of choice.
For now I have been working with five weapon prototypes and them layouts.

Here is some prototypes:



I also have to code a system how to handle the animations changes and such. For now the whole system is very simple; I only have to handle shooting and idle animation changes. Some weapons might have some special animations, but for now I let those a side.
