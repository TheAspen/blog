## The project is on Steam!

When I pressed the publish button for Enfora Star's Steam page it felt a somewhat surrealistic. I have just published my very first Steam pages. Over a year I have been working on this prototype, but now it is finally starting to take a shape like a real game. At least, now it feels like it is a real game, when it is on Steam. Alas, it was only the store page and one week later the playable Alpha, but still, this was a huge milestone for myself.

I'm not going to list all problems I encountered during the process to get Steam pages up, but I'll say this again: If you are first timer, take a good month with this and create your capsule images before!
I struggeled a bit the page building process and the same time I was working with the capsule images and also debugging the project. (And yes, I also have a day job.. )
It was.. somewhat overhelming.

But, in the end Steam provides very good introduction to everything, you just have to look deep enough whatever you are doing. The help might not be found from the first page you visit.
