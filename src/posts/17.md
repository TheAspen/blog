## The project is on Steam!

When I pressed the publish button for Enfora Star's Steam page, it felt somewhat surrealistic. I have just published my very first Steam pages. Over a year I have been working on this project, but now it is finally starting to take shape as a real game. At least, now it feels like it is an actual game when it is on Steam. Alas, it was only the store page and one week later the playable Alpha, but still, this was a huge milestone for me.

## Not all went so smoothly

I'm not going to list all the problems I encountered during the process to get Steam pages up, but I'll say this again: If you are a first-timer, take a good month with this and create your capsule images before!

I struggled a bit with the page-building process, and at the same time, I was working with the capsule images and also debugging the project. (And yes, I also have a day job…)
It was… somewhat overwhelming.

But, in the end, Steam provides a very good introduction to everything; you just have to look deep enough at whatever you are doing. The help might not be found from the first page you visit.

You can check out the pages from here: **[To Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3552750/Enfora_Star/)**

Remember to test the Alpha version and provide feedback!
It really helps me to figure out what needs to be fixed or changed.

There is the Alpha gameplay trailer too!

## So, the Alpha is out? But how is the feedback?

Well, it seems like gathering feedback from people is not that easy as I thought, and I really have some difficulties getting any feedback at all. I usually get one or two comments here and there, but huge amount of positive neither negative input I haven't yet received. Which is a bit of a shame, because the feedback is really crucial for me so that I know what I need to fix in the game.

I'm not sure should I create a Discord channel or so? I just think that wouldn't make any difference. But, even one feedback is something to work on and I'm trying to get more people to play this game all the time. This just makes me think; if people are not interested in playing this game, is the game too boring or difficult to get into?

## What is coming next?

While I'm trying to get people to test this, I'm working on the new enemies for the game. I have also done some background music, which you might hear on the possible videos I have plans to make, but let's not ruin all surprises. ;)

For now, orange and pink have got "bigger brothers or sisters," but probably all of them will get one too.

Here is the orange's "big brother" for reference:

This "big brother" will shoot missiles randomly around. Furthermore, all these V2 enemies will get some sort of special ability.

Planning has also taken place for the upcoming months. And now the next big thing is to get the Beta version up and running. Beta will take several months to accomplish, but I have a good feeling about this project. Even though my timetable shows that I do not have enough time to get everything ready for the planned release date.

And of course, bug fixes (and new bugs) are done on the way too.

That is all for now!
