## How I found Godot?

The first time I ever heard of Godot Engine was when I was studying at the Kajaani University of Applied Sciences (referred to as "university" later in the text.) and I was searching for a game engine for mobile development on the internet. Basically, I just accidentally found the engine by browsing, and something just got me when I opened Godot's website. At that time, the newest Godot version was 2.1.

I downloaded the engine when I got back to home and started studying a little bit. I found the first tutorial in the official documentation; if I remember correctly, it was some sort of pong game. I made the tutorial, and already I noticed how simple GDScript was to understand and the whole hierarchy of the game objects in the process. At least back then, I had issues understanding how every object communicates through the game engine and how I, for example, trigger an event from another object to another. With Godot and its tree-like hierarchy, it was very easy to understand the relationships.

Also, the engine was very easy and fast to install and get up and running. In the university, we mostly use Unity or Unreal Engine, and Unreal Engine took ages to install from scratch. Of course, Godot was in a very early stage back then, and you could not do very complex games with it compared to Unity or UE.

The time passed, and when it was time for my thesis work, I decided to do it with Godot Engine 3.0. The thesis name was "2D game development with Godot Engine 3.0." Back then, I did a simple game demo; it was an RPG game that took lots of influences from the first Zelda from Nintendo 8-bit. Basic movement, fighting, inventory, and very simple enemies. I also added a dialogue system from scratch, and that was kind of a mess. If you are interested in the code base (I don't recommend using it as a reference or as is in the real project!), it can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/TheAspen/TM_Thesis

That was the time when I really got into the Godot Engine. Godot 3.0 was a very advanced engine compared to 2.1. and again, it was much lighter than Unity or Unreal Engine.
Simple to useâ€”that was and still is my favorite thing in Godot.

## Choosing the game engine

When I restarted the Star Defender project I had to do a hard decision. The original project was started with Godot 3.x version, can't remember which one, but Godot have already released 4.0 version (and also 4.1. but that engine has JUST released and I think it is a bit risk to select engine version which has just came out.). Which, of course, has some advantages to graphics and many other things. In the first post I mentioned the horror game project which I have started, that one was created with Godot 3.x version, but I imported to the 4.0 version and some point. And.. that did not went so smoothly.

I had to reconnect all signals, which itself was a huge manual labor, but some function names, parameters or return values had changed too. So there was plenty of work, even if the project wasn't that huge. Major engine changes usually take some import work for you project, and that switch from Godot 3.5 to 4.0 was not that bad, but extra work is always an extra work.

So that import experience in mind I thought it was to best keep up with the 3.5 and it has long-term support anyways.

For now, 3.5. it is more reliable and stable compared to 4.0. On Linux I have got some random crashes on 3.5., but nothing major there either. The game what I do is very simple in the grapchical sence, so I do not need fancier grapchical systems which Godot 4.0 has. Which again takes us to that 3.5. is a bit lighter game engine, and I like game engine runs smoothly.
Of course the experience what I got doing my thesis, help the selection too. I could go 3.5. which uses the same functions or go with Godot 4.0 which has changed some functions working logic. Nothing major, but all little errors or problems could be caused by wrongly used function (which has worked before) and therefore slowed down the project.

#### _A Little disclaimer_

When I wrote this I got a feeling that I think 3.5. version is superior to compared 4.0 (or any 4.x version), which it is not. I want to point out that these were just my personal opinions, not a absolute facts. Godot 4.x has taken the engine to good direction in general, so it is not a bad engine to be selected for you project if you decide so.

## At the end

I think it was a pure coincidence how I ended up to work with Godot. One internet search which changed so many things. I used stand for Unreal Engine team, (which is a good game engine too.), but today I used Godot basically every game engine projects I do.

Let's see what the future throw at us!
